# Graph-matching-PPM-matlab
This repository contains minimal matlab code to reproduce the experiments in the paper 'Seeded graph matching for the correlated Wigner model via the projected power method' by Ernesto Araya, Guillaume Braun, Hemant Tyagi.

The file comparison_graph_matching.m contains an example of the execution of PPM with a random initialization on a neighborhood of the grounf truth (by default generated uniformly at random). Also contains other graph matching methods for comparison. 

The file matching_proj_it_in.m has the code of the PPMGM algorithm described in the reference. 

The file GMWM_alg.m contains the code for the Greedy Maximum Weighted Matching described in the reference.
